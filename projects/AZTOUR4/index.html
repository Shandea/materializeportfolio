              <p id="info">At its peak, Tombstone is said to have been the fastest growing city between St.Louis and
                San
                Francisco.There were over
                one hundered saloons, numerous restaurants, a large red-light district, schools, churches, newspapers,
                and one of the first public swimming pools (which is still used today).
                Tombstone's post office was established December 2, 1878 and has yet to be discontinued.The most
                famous
                event in Tombstone's history was the famed Gunfight at Ok Corral,
                which didn't actually happen at the corral, but in a vacant lot on Fremont Street. On October 26,
                1881,
                members of the "Cowboys",
                had a run-in with Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan Earp with help from Wyatt's friend Doc Holliday. 24seconds
                and 30 shots later, Billy Clanton, Tom and Frank McLaury were mortally wounded.
                In many people's opinion it was this one event that has kept Tombstone alive for all these years.There
                was actually five Earps. They were Virgil, Morgan, Wyatt, Warren and James.
                There were two newspapers on Tombstone, The Tombstone Epitaph edited by Jonh Clum and The Tombstone
                Daily Nugget founded by H.M Woods in 1880. The Epitaph took a Republican view on events
                in town while The Nugget was supported by the Democrats. There was an ice-cream parlour that was very
                popular with the locals, including Wyatt Earp. There was a few theaters in town, the
                most famouos of them being Schieffelin Hall and The Bird Cage Theater. Sirens were used in Tombstone
                to
                mark the begining of a new shift for the miners. After the gunfight on October 26, 1881, sirens
                went off from the Vizna mine and miners poured up onto the street, armed and ready. Saloons were open
                24
                hours a day in Tombstone. This included The Oriental, The Crystal Place Saloon, The Eagle Saloon
                and The Alhambra. Saloons could be quite decadent and served Whiskey and Brandy, a six-year-old
                Kentucky
                Apple Brandy, Gin Rum, Sherry, Port, English Ale, Scotch, Millers Extra and 26 different imported
                wines. The Oriental bragged at having piano and violin concerts every night and was llit with
                chandeliers. Restaurants in Tombstone such as The Can Can,The Russ House, The Elite House ant The
                Malson
                Doree,
                catered to all tastes including fine dining. Fresh shrimp and oysters were brought in from California
                to
                Tucson in registered train cars, then transported down to Tombstone.

              <p id="info">Beautiful 2,400 acre desert park, on the National Register of Historic Places, showcasing
                the
                crystal-filled Colossal Cave and historic La Posta Quemada Ranch,
                cave tours, mueseum, western trail rides and wooded picnic areas and spectacular cowboy cookouts under
                the stars. Bonecrusher and Fang and the names of some of the largest
                stalactites in Colossal Caves in Vail, Arizona. The cave was formed during the Mississippian Period,
                over 320 million years ago, when water seeped through the rocks and
                and dissolved away part of the limestone, leaving behind the third largest cave in the world. Colossal
                Cave is one of the 5% of the dry/dormat caves in the world, meaning
                that it is still alive but no longer growing. This also means it is one of the rare caves pictures can
                be taken in.The cave isn't the only thing that this park holds for visitors,
                though. A few minutes down the road, 120-year-old La Posta Quemada Ranch, site of an old stagecoach
                station, hostess the Ranch Headquarters House, which is home for the mueseum,
                research library, another beautiful gift shop, and open-air cafe serving Mexican food. Here you can
                sit
                in the natural habitat butterfly garden and watch butterflies whiz around
                your head and observe tortise as they wonder about their stone enclosure. There is a riding stable
                where
                trail rides are available and the Analemmatic Sundial where you can be the
                shadow that tells the time. Special reservations can be made for cattle drives, cowboy cookouts and
                kids' birthday parties. If you like to camp, there are secluded campsites near Posta Quemada
                Wash. While there you can hike on the 2,577 acres the Park covers and spot many animals, such as a
                ringtail, a coatimundi, javelina and striped skunk. Colossal Cave Mountain Park offers a
                variety of activities for all interest, whether you want a day-outting or rough it on a camping trip.

                The natural wonder is a must-see for anyone who wants a truly unique experience. The formations,

                Gary Tenen and Randy Tutfs.
                However, the public didn't learn about the Caverns until 1988 when Gary and Randy told the owners

                and Lois
                Kartchner. Kartchner Caverns
