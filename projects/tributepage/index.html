                Construction was completed in January 1964. The facility consisted of a one-mile oval and a 2.5-mile road
                course.Alan Kulwicki won the first Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race at Phoenix on Nov. 6, 1988.
                The first spring race was held on April 23, 2005 and was also the first night race, which was won by Kurt
                Busch.The track underwent its first repave in 2011. The construction began in March and concluded in September of
                that year.The following changes were made during the construction period (March â€“ Sept. 2011):
                Widened the frontstretch from 52 to 62 feet and reconfigured pit road with the installation of concrete pit stalls
                Pushed the dog-leg curve between Turn 2 and Turn 3 out 95 feet and tightened the turn radius of the dog-leg
                from 800 to 500 feet. Implemented banking, including 11-degree banking between Turn 1 and Turn 2; 10-11-degree banking in the
                apex of the dog-leg; and 9-degree banking in Turns 3 and 4.Following the 2017 season, the track was renamed from Phoenix 
                Raceway to ISM Raceway.ISM Raceway under went reconstruction following the Spring race of 2018, with many new fan amenities added
                to the track, as well as the track itself being reconfigured so that the start/finish line is now just before the dog
                leg.There have been 45 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series races at ISM Raceway, one per season from 1988-2004 and two each season since.
